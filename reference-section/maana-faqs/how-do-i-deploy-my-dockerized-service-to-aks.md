## Question

#### How do I deploy my dockerized service to AKS?

I have a Knowledge Service in a Docker container and would like to deploy it to Azure using the Azure Kubernetes Service?

I see there are few tutorials:

* [Quickstart: Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service \(AKS\) cluster using the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough)
* [Deploy Docker image to Azure Kubernetes Service AKS from dashboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VafY-qfpM8M)
* [Deploy Docker image to Azure Kubernetes Service AKS using YAML files & kubectl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iHsPGbPSlQ)

Is there a Maana best practice?
