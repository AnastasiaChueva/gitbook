# Fact Recognition Tutorials

The distinction between Fact Recognition Service and Fact Recognition Bot Service is as follows:

1. [Fact Recognition Service](fact-recognition.md) performs [fact \(or relation\) tuple extraction](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/openie.html) from unstructured text
2. [Fact Recognition Bot Service](creating-a-fact-recognition-bot.md) connects the FR capabilities with the Maana platform, so that facts can be extracted directly from Kinds, and stored directly to other Kinds.
