# Classify Text

Imagine a file instance corpus of 300,000 documents represent the log information from 10,000 wells. This equivocates to 100,000 problem-comments per well for 10,000 wells. As an observing and reasoning facilitator, Maana enables users to:

* Auto classify text or documents based on pre-trained classifiers
* Allow user to manually trigger pre-trained classifiers to run and classify selected text or documents
* Allow advanced users the ability to easily train new classifiers provided an adequate training set \(and test it as well\) 
  * Provide user with suggestions regarding training set quality/quantity
* Show progress of text or document classification or at least some indication of status
* Provide ability to view text or documents and validate or change classification results
* Show advanced users details such as classification metrics \(accuracy, precision, recall, etc.\), classifier applied, featurizer applied etc.

Use the following document classification for feature building/testing:

1. Health Environment and Safety Reports - Incident reports \(here are examples [https://euoag.jrc.ec.europa.eu/?q=alerts](https://euoag.jrc.ec.europa.eu/?q=alerts)\)
2. Daily Drilling reports.
3. Cement Reports
4. Casing Reports
5. Geology Reports
6. Directional Reports
7. Contracts
8. End of Well Reports
