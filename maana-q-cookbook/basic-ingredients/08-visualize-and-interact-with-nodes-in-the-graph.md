# 08: Visualize & Interact with Nodes in the Graph

\[TBD\]

While building or querying graphs, as a user, I need to have the ability to visualize its components \(Kinds, Queries, Files\) at all times. Information can of course be represented in many forms. Generally, the expectation is for the platform to automatically present the selected source in the most relevant visualization format. 

Other requirements:

* Ability to preview data
* Ability to view entire data source
* Ability to apply visually interactive filters \(especially for the query graph\)
* Ability to visualize/interact with geo coordinate data via map visualizations
* Ability to visualize/curate entities extracted via the entity extraction service
* Ability to visualize/curate classification labels provided via the text classification service
