# Mine Text

Text forms a huge part of the type of data that Maana Q users will interact with, especially when building out the KG. Text will primarily exist in the form of Fields in structured files or entire unstructured documents. The primary reason to mine text in Maana is to create an association of key terms/entities and labels \(groups of things\) in order to answer complex questions. The answers to these complex questions today are usually spread across various silo'd structured data sources and unstructured sources and often in text form.

Consider this text as an example:

"Well 234 - 09/02/03 RU CT. Filled CT unit with 12.6 ppg CaBr. Tested CT & BOPs to 6000 psi. RIH with CT to 3000' \(unable to get below GLM \#2\). POOH with CT. RIH with CT & tagged obstruction @ 9935'. Washed to 9947' & broke thru - lost circulation. POOH to 9000' & regained circulation. RIH with CT to 10179'. PU 10' from bottom & circulated to clean out well. Note: Received verbal approval from MMS - Houma for CT operations."

As a user, I would like Maana's bots to automatically:

* Mine this text and identify mentions of entities \(incl. values\), and facts
* Classify it into the right category

At this point, the option to trigger text mining services manually if needed becomes useful. Operational requirements seek to observe status indicators which show the progress of text mining.
