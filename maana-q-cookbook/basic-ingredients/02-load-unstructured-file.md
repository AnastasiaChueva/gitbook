# 02: Load Unstructured File

\[TBD\]  
â€‹[boem\_doc\_classifier.txt](https://confluence.corp.maana.io/download/attachments/36995840/boem_doc_classifier.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1518024886055&api=v2) has a list of BOEM file types and their classifier that could be used for this use case

In addition to having the ability to load structured files, the user should also be able to load unstructured files into Maana. The ultimate goal is to be able to link the two sources together \(where feasible\) in order to serve up a wholistic view of all relevant information around a topic or problem.

Upload should be supported by "drag-and-drop" or using the upload icon in the in the Explorer.

A Document Kind instance will appear in the Explorer and on the current/default KG, representing the physical file and associated metadata \(e.g., URL, MIME type, size, status\)

If the file transfer is long, a progress indicator will be shown and cancellation action provided.
