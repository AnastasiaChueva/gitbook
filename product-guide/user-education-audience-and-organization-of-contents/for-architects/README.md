# For Architects

Architects main responsibilities lay in Domain and Function Modeling. After assisting Analysts with Problem Decomposition, Architects take the PQs and develop a set of requirements. These requirements then feed into the solution architecture. To create the solution architecture, Architects create the Domains and Functions that will directly feed the data into the microservices.
