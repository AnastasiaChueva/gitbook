In addition to [https://bitbucket.corp.maana.io/projects/H4/repos/h4/pull-requests/916/diff](https://bitbucket.corp.maana.io/projects/H4/repos/h4/pull-requests/916/diff), there should be another check that mapping function has only one argument.

  
CKG is currently proactively rejecting functions in MapF if arguments list has length not equal to one.
