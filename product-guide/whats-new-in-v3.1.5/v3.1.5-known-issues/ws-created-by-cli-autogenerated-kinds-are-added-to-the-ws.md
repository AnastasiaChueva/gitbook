{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Description" %}
We shouldn't add autogenerated kinds to the WS. Only to the inventory. PFA.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Repro Steps" %}
1. Using CLI create schema, service and upload a couple of files.
2. Open created WS from the UI
3. Check autogenerated Kinds and functions in the inventory.

Autogenerated functions and kinds are in the inventory under section Autogenerated.

Autogenerated functions are in the correct section in inventory, but all autogenerated kinds are under Kinds sections in inventory and added to the WS.
