# Computational Knowledge Graph

## The Computational Knowledge Graph

The Maana Computational Knowledge Graphâ„¢ \(CKG\) is a network of models that optimize specific operations and decisions flows, by providing recommendations through AI-Driven Applications. This unique technology eliminates the need to move data, and enables creation of thousands of models at scale, through the re-usability of models across the enterprise.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example**:  A working, real-world example of a CKG might be a Knowledge Graph that contains a network of models describing the oil wells dug in the Gulf of Mexico during the last 50 years-including companies, people, equipment and activities involved, etc.

**Knowledge Accelerator Tip:** Check out our short Tutorial \(link to Tutorial doc\) with a specific, dataset-driven example on how you can create and explore a CKG. It will help you move much faster when you will create the first CKG from your own data!
