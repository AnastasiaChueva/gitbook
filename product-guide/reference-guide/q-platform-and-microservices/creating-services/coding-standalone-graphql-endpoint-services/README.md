# Coding Standalone GraphQL Endpoint Services

Q platform capabilities include leveraging a GraphQL endpoint as a "service". To benefit from the rich features Q provides around services, developers may want to build their own GraphQL endpoints exposing green-field or brown-field \(wrapping legacy APIs\) functionality. Developers can, of course, develop a GraphQL endpoint in the language/framework of their choosing. To help accelerate this process, Maana offers a set of language-specific GraphQL service templates that explicate how GraphQL services can be developed to offer different functionality.
