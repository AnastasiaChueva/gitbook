# Implementation of a Function

\[TBD\] @Bryan

**TODO**: Description of what the function implementation is

Function with implementation that can be viewed and edited in Maana Q will have their names on the graph underlined, whereas a function that is from a service that was brought into Maana Q will not have their names underlined on the graph.

## Creating a Basic Implementation <a id="creating-a-basic-implementation"></a>

**TODO**: Talk about going into the function composition view, adding a function, and connecting it all up.

## Executing The Function <a id="executing-the-function"></a>

**TODO**: Move the information about function execution here, and flesh it out

### Results from Function Execution <a id="results-from-function-execution"></a>

**TODO**: Move the information about the results from function execution here, and talk more about it also.

​

## TODO: The below text and images should be worked into the new framework. <a id="todo-the-below-text-and-images-should-be-worked-into-the-new-framework"></a>

​

**TODO**: below text should be part of the function execution below

Every function can be executed. And when you execute the top level function, you're essentially executing the entire graph underneath it, passing the values through waiting for all of the things to finish and resolve. And then you get the result.

**TODO**: The information in the below image should be broken out and moved to the appropriate sections of Creating a Function.

## Implementation <a id="implementation"></a>

**TODO**: The information in the below image should be broken out and added to the appropriate sections.

Implementation for a function is sourced from other functions, or Services. Services can be added to the Workspace Inventory after those Services are added to the System inventory \(aka the organization catalog\).

For Example: Well Distance 3 has been added to the System inventory already with Name, Endpoint, and URL.

## Add a Service to the Workspace Inventory <a id="add-a-service-to-the-workspace-inventory"></a>

**TODO**: This should be part of prepping the workspace \(Function Modeling page\). and description should be removed from image

NOTE: Why do I want to do this? What's the link between Implementing a Function and Adding a Service to the Workspace Inventory

##  Running functions in the workspace \(UI\), and from GraphQL <a id="running-functions-in-the-workspace-ui-and-from-graphql"></a>

**TODO**: Extract the explanation from the images, and then build up more information about running the function.

1. Functions and Implementations can be executed via the Run panel.
2. Expand and complete the onscreen fields;
3. Click Run.
4. Or: Navigate to GraphiQL from the workspace and exec.
