# Examples

\[TBD\] @Bryan

**TODO**: This should be the actual sandwich shop example. We should probably see if we don't have any more laying around. One Idea is that this might be better to sit next to Domain Modeling and Function Modeling, as once you have learned about the modeling we should have some overall examples. Oh and the well maintenance distance example used in the tutorial should also be in here.

## Building Sandwich Shop

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
