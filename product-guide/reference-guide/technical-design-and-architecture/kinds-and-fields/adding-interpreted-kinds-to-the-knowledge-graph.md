# Adding Interpreted Kinds to the Knowledge Graph

**Interpreted Kinds** are the net result of Bots/Microservices parsing Raw Data Kinds.

**Example**: A Field classifier analyses the Raw Data Kind, and produces interpretations of individual fields and their values against Kinds and instances \(e.g., People, Places, Organizations, Categorical\) that already exist within the system. The Named Entity Recognition \(NER\) Microservice then extracts the values corresponding with the identified entities.

### How to Add Interpreted Kinds to the Knowledge Graph <a id="how-to-add-interpreted-kinds-to-the-knowledge-graph"></a>

1. Select the Raw Data Kind to use.
2. Microservices will then identify any Interpreted Kinds in the **Links** tab located in the **Control Panel** to the right of the screen.
3. Then choose the Interpreted Kinds they require, and select **Add to KG** to add to the Knowledge Graph.
4. The Interpreted Kinds will appear in blue in the Knowledge Graph after they have been added, together with the inbound/outbound relations to other kinds \(refer to the example provided below\).
