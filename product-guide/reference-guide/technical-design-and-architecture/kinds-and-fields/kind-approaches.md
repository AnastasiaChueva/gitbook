# Kind Approaches

## Creating Kinds to Build a Knowledge Graph 

There are two ways to create the kinds of data used as the building blocks for your Knowledge Graph:

1. The Data-First Approach
2. The Model-First Approach

## Data-First Approach

#### With the Data-First Approach:

* You upload the files into the portal.
* The Maana microservices \(bots\) analyze the raw data and generates an _initial_ Knowledge Graph with interpreted Kinds and suggested relations between Kinds. 
* You then validate these interpretations, and curate these interpreted Kinds.
* Then, you enrich the initial Knowledge Graph with new Kinds that may be created manually.

## Model First Approach

#### With the Model-First Approach:

* First, you manually create Kinds as a part of a model design.
* Then, you connect the manually created Kinds with the data sources \(uploaded as Raw Data Kinds\).
