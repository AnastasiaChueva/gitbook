# About Knowledge Applications

Knowledge applications are use cases developed by users on the Maana platform.

They are built to provide AI-driven recommendations into operational decisions across an Enterprise.

A knowledge application is made up of domain and decision models that perform real-time calculations in order to provide solutions to some of the most complex questions faced by end users. 

Each application can have a custom UI designed to suit the specific needs of the relevant users or be operationalized via embedding it into existing applications/user flows. 

A customer does not have access to knowledge applications developed by other customers.
