## To Log In <a id="to-log-in"></a>

1. Go to the web address provided by IT admin.
2. Login using one of the 2 methods described below:

If single sign-on \(SSO\) is enabled by your IT, enter your email address and select **Log in,** or log in with a Google identity. Once logged in, you can:

* Add/change info on your profile \(e.g. name, add a picture, email address, etc.\)
* Choose between a Light or Dark portal theme
* "Subscribe to Links" allows new [Links](../reference-guide/technical-design-and-architecture/links.md) to automatically appear in the browser, as opposed to refreshing to see them \(may result in lower performance\).
* Log out
