# Deleting a Service

## Delete a Service

A service can be deleted both from the Services tab and from within the service information page. To delete a Service from the Services tab, click on the delete icon next to the Service name.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Beware of the implications of deleting a service. All Kinds and Functions within the service will be deleted as well. Any references to the deleted Kinds, Functions, or the service within Workspaces will no longer be valid.

An alternative way to delete a service is from the service details page.

You will be presented with the same confirmation dialog as above.

Only user created services can be deleted. System generated services cannot.
