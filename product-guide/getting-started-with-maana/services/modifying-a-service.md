# Modifying a Service

Services can be modified by opening the Service details page. Click on the service on the Services page to open the details page.

On the Service Details page, you can modify any of the values, except the Service Type. You will notice it looks very similar to page when adding a new service but it also includes the service ID at the top.

You will notice that some services cannot be modified. Any service generated by the system cannot be changed.

### Refreshing a Service

Their are a couple of additional buttons at the bottom. **Delete,** which will be covered in the next section and **Refresh**.

The **Refresh** button is very important, especially if a service is being actively worked on. Clicking **Refresh** will refetch the schema from the service and update the service Kinds and Functions in Q based on the new schema. It will essentially pick up any changes made to the schema and save them to Q. As changes to a schema could result in removal of Kinds, Functions, and Fields within Q, you will be presented with a warning dialog.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Beware of the implications of refreshing a service. Kinds, Functions, and Fields within the service that no longer exist will be deleted. Any references to the deleted Kinds, Functions, or the service within Workspaces will no longer be valid. The Kinds, Functions, and Fields created from a GraphQL schema are based on name in the schema, thus changing the name of something in the schema will cause the Kind, Function, or Field with the old name to be deleted and a new one to be created with the new name.
{% endhint %}

### Saving Changes to a Service

Clicking the **Save** button has the same implications as the **Refresh** button. In addition to updating the details of the service, it will refresh the service schema as described above.
