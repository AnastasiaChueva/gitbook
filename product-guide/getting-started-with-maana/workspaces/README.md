# Workspaces

## What is a Workspace?

A workspace is a dedicated place within the Maana portal where you can build, visualize and explore your Maana Computational Knowledge Graph, or CKG. The Maana portal home page features a tab called **Workspaces**, where you can find:

* **My Workspaces** – This area displays the workspaces that you have previously created.
* **Shared Workspaces** – This area displays the workspaces that multiple users share.
* **Workspace Templates** – This area can be used to create a new workspace from an existing template.

Think of the workspace as your notebook, like actual physical place that you make notes in and think of a knowledge graph as a page in that notebook.  A workspace is a unit of work \(a container\) for kinds and functions. Each workspace is also a service, callable via GraphQL. And, each workspace can have knowledge graphs and function graphs.
