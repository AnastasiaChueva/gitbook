# Creating a New Workspace

## Create a New Workspace

As mentioned earlier, your Workspace is the key to utilizing the Computational Knowledge Graph \(CKG\) and unlocking the power of the Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) data stream.  If you are not using an existing Workspace, you will want to create one of your own.  This can be done in a few steps.

* Select the **Workspaces** tab at the top of the Maana portal,
* Select the blue circle with the "**+**" icon in it located in the upper left of your screen.  Your screen should now display a new Workspace that you have created, named **Untitled**, similar to the one shown in the example found below.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**:  To close your Workspace, select the "-" button located in the upper right corner of your screen.
{% endhint %}

A new workspace with the name **Untitled** is created.

Selecting the icon for the **Untitled** Workspace will open a secondary menu bar, where you can name your new Workspace, and decide if you wish to make it public using the **Context** Panel on the right of your screen.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**:  As soon as you create a Workspace, it is instantly considered to be a Service.  If you want to start interact with that Service, you can do so by clicking on the workspace and clicking on the info icon.  This will result in the ID window popping up on the right-hand side of the screen \(for renaming\) and the GraphiQL window popping up across the bottom of the screen \(for querying\).
{% endhint %}

## My Workspaces

Once a workspace is created it will automatically be saved, and will appear in the **My Workspaces** area of the **Workspaces Tab**.
