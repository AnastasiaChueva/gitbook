# About Domain Modeling

### What is Domain Modeling? <a id="what-is-domain-modeling"></a>

Maana refers to the process of modeling out a business problem as Domain Modeling, because it helps to reinforce the defined scope of a knowledge solution/service. The goal is not to model out an organization's entire business and all associated problems in one initial attempt. 

Successful build efforts begin by focusing on a certain domain of the business and specific business problem therein. Modeling out multiple business problems across multiple domains, over time, is a worthwhile, long-term goal, but it's not an appropriate starting point for a new Maana user.
