# About Function Modeling

## What is a Function

A function is the _computational_ part of solving a problem question. Functions provide the ability to build and model a solution to a problem question at the same time. Your model is the solution! Functions are composed of other functions, each modeling a problem-question. The top-level Function models the top-level problem-question. As you decompose the problem-question, you will create Functions to model each of the inner problem-questions.

Functions have three main parts:

* **Inputs** give the ability to pass data into the Functions for use in calculations.
* **Outputs** are the result of the calculations.
* **Implementation** is the part that does the calculations. A Function's implementation can be part of a service that is running somewhere, or it can be built directly in Q using other Functions.

Learn more about the basics of functions [here](../../understanding-functions.md).

## Setting Up Your Environment

Perform the following steps to get your Workspace ready for developing your solution. This will set you up to model quickly and efficiently. Note that this is not meant to be a one-time process. As you model, your solution will most likely change or you will think of things you hadn't initially. At that point you may need to come back and do some of these steps again \(such as adding new services\).

1. Think about the domain and what sort of things you will need to have calculated.
2. Add the services that contain functions and types that you will use in your solution to Q if they don't already exist \(see [adding services](../../../services/adding-a-service.md)\)
3. Add the services with those types and functions to the inventory of your Workspace \(see [Searching](../../../searching.md) for details\)
