# About Function Modeling

## What is a Function

A function is the _computational_ part of solving a problem question. Functions provide the ability to build up the solution to a problem question one block at a time. They can have other functions inside of to help build up all the blocks needed to solve the problem question.

Functions have three main parts:

* **Inputs** give the ability to pass in data for help with the calculations.
* **Outputs** are the result of the calculations.
* **Implementation** is the part that does the calculations. A function's implementation can be part of a service that is running somewhere, or it can be build up within Maana Q from many different functions.

Learn more about the basics of functions [here](../../understanding-functions.md).

## Example Problem-Question \(Functions\)

Problem Questions: Given a Service Depot location and two wells, ...

* What is the optimal route for delivering equipment?
  * What is the distance to the closest well?
    * Which well is closest?
  * What is the distance between the service depot and the other two wells?
* What is the total distance travelled between the three points?

## Setting Up Your Environment

1. Add the necessary external services to the platform
2. Bring those services into your workspace via the Maana search feature
3. Making sure you have done the "Domain Modeling" section so you have all the required kinds. These will be useful when fields of the functions you are defining or not just scalar but actual rich types such as the previously defined kinds
4. Figure out if anything is missing from this list
