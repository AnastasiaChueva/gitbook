# Modeling Problem Questions

The goal here is to decompose the top level problem-question \(PQ\) into parts that can be solved for directly using a service. 

This service could already be created or it may be something that needs to be created. 

Each component represents a Function within a service that when connected together create the top level PQ, where the subjects of the PQ are the inputs and the object of the PQ is the output. 

Each part of the top level PQ is itself a PQ of a narrower scope within the domain. The goal is to reach a solution that uses existing Functions to create the top level Function \(representing the top level PQ\).
